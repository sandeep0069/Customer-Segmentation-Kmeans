# Customer-Segmentation-Kmeans
**This project demonstrates Customer Segmentation using K-Means clustering to identify distinct groups of mall customers based on their demographic and behavioral attributes. The primary objective is to analyze customer purchasing patterns and support data-driven marketing strategies by grouping customers with similar characteristics.**

**The workflow includes data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and feature scaling to ensure accurate clustering. The Elbow Method and Silhouette Score are used to determine the optimal number of clusters, improving model reliability. To enhance interpretability and visualization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to project high-dimensional data into a two-dimensional space.**

**The resulting clusters reveal meaningful customer segments such as high-income high-spending customers, budget-conscious customers, and average spenders. Based on these insights, targeted marketing recommendations can be formulated, including personalized offers, loyalty programs, and promotional strategies.**

**This project highlights the practical application of unsupervised machine learning techniques in real-world business scenarios and demonstrates how clustering algorithms can uncover hidden patterns in customer data to support strategic decision-making.**
